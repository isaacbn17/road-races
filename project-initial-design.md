**Road Races Database**

Runnercard is a common service road races use in Utah for registration, timing, and results.
I'd like to know the most competitive races in Utah (which races are the fastest, which have the most participants, course records, etc.).
To find out, I'll scrape the website to get historical data (as well as add data after a race is complete) and insert this into Supabase.
I'll then create a website use nextjs where you can ask a question, which ChatGPT will try to answer using the database schema.
