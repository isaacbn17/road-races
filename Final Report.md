## Final Project Report

### Project Summary
My project is a website where you are able to query a database containing tens of thousands of results from runnercard.com
(a popular race timing and results website in Utah).

(If this doesn't work just check out the website!)

### Things Learned
1.  **Data gathering** It took me just over 11 hours to scrape runnercard and clean the data, which is much longer than I intially expected. I learned that spot checking data for problems often decreases wasted time in when gathering and cleaning data.
2.  **Collaboration** I didn't know how to query Supabase from the website and spent an hour or two reading irrelevant documentation. Getting some help from Dr. Reynolds showed me that I was looking in the wrong place to find an answer to my question. I feel like I should be more open to getting help, asking questions, and collaborating with other people to solve problems.
3.  **Designing** Near the end of my project, I realized that it wasn't possible to query the database with aggregation (in the method I was using). This made me rethink the design of my application. I wish I had simply selected the content of both tables then created ways on the website to filter the tables. This would have made the end product closer to my goal.

### AI Integration
I integrated with ChatGPT in two different ways for this project.
