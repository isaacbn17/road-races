| **11/4/2025**  | 7:45 PM    | 8:46 PM  | 1:01  | Created repository, initial design, and beginning of web scraper.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **11/5/2025**  | 4:23 PM    | 5:01 PM  | 0:38  | Worked on the webscraper for runnercard. I was running into an issue where requests would only return part of the HTML. After an hour of work, I learned that I needed to include a headers property to mimic an actual web browser and get the full page. |
| **11/5/2025**  | 5:14 PM    | 5:57 PM  | 0:43  | See above                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **11/10/2025** | 7:34 AM    | 8:57 AM  | 1:23  | More work on webscraping. I now have a .txt file with 360 links to results pages.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **11/11/2025** | 7:50 AM    | 8:56 AM  | 1:06  | Continued work on getting the results from the tables. I have a function that returns a list of lists containing the table data for a URL.                                                                                                                 |
| **11/12/2025** | 8:08 AM    | 10:20 AM | 2:12  | At last, I've got two CSV files. I'll make two tables out of them: races and results.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **11/15/2025** | 11:48 AM   | 12:28 PM | 0:40  | Cleaned the data and set up a Next.js with Supabase website using Vercel.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **11/18/2025** | 8:17 AM    | 8:41 AM  | 0:24  | Uploaded the data to Supabase. Immediately, I noticed some problems with the race results. There are cycling 5Ks whose times are much faster than running and some of the time values are a place value instead.                                           |
| **11/18/2025** | 10:58 AM   | 12:22 PM | 1:24  | Created a pipeline for getting the race results correctly. I'm going to rerun this to get results from earlier years.                                                                                                                                      |
| **11/18/2025** | 3:18 PM    | 4:50 PM  | 1:32  | Accounting for edge cases and fixing bugs in the pipeline that resulted in bad data.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **11/18/2025** | 5:08 PM    | 5:46 PM  | 0:38  | A little more data cleaning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **11/19/2025** | 5:58 PM    | 6:22 PM  | 0:24  | Got the website running locally and created an account.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **11/19/2025** | 8:13 PM    | 9:01 PM  | 0:48  | I have two pages. One returns the races table and the other the results table.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **11/20/2025** | 3:14 PM    | 4:37 PM  | 1:23  | I made a road races page with an outline for submitting questions that will be answered using ChatGPT and Supabase.                                                                                                                                        |
| **11/21/2025** | 4:54 PM    | 6:01 PM  | 1:07  | I'm trying to integrate with the Supabase Data API. I'm having trouble doing this.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **11/25/2025** | 10:24 AM   | 11:34 AM | 1:10  | Integrated with the database. Now the race results are displayed on the page.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **12/1/2025**  | 2:14 PM    | 4:13 PM  | 1:59  | I integrated with ChatGPT. The user's question is sent to ChatGPT and translated into a Supabase query the client can execute. The results of this query are then sent to ChatGPT to be formatted in a readable, user-friendly way.                        |
| **12/3/2025**  | 2:06 PM    | 2:27 PM  | 0:21  | Worked on writing queries to give to ChatGPT as an example.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **12/5/2025**  | 2:33 PM    | 3:50 PM  | 1:17  | Added a new page to the website for recent queries. Also updated the prompt for ChatGPT, adding more examples.                                                                                                                                             |
| **12/10/2025** | 10:05 AM   | 10:32 AM | 0:27  | Added a races and results tab to the website that displays the tables.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
